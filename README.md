** City Explorer Lab-07-back-end

**Author**: Sue Duclos and Eyob Tamir
**Version**: 1.0.0

** Overview
The application will provide a user information about a selected city to explore. This lab will consist of building a stand-alone back-end which will interact with a static front end. We will request data from third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser.
